In March of 2018 I read an article on pen plotters (oldschool printers that use a literal pen to do their writing).  Within 24 hours I fell in love with the idea and purchased my own, an HP7475A, manufactured back in 1983.

Since then I have been playing with the pen plotter, gradually teaching it to do more complex things.  These scripts are those things.
