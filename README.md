# Voronize

Quite honestly, this is a piece of code that I don't expect anybody other than myself ever to run or care about.

In March of 2018 I read an article on pen plotters (oldschool printers that use a literal pen to do their writing).  Within 24 hours I fell in love with the idea and purchased my own, an HP7475A, manufactured back in 1983.

Since then I have been playing with the pen plotter, gradually teaching it to do more complex things.

## Usage

It's a python script.  It has argparse and I filled in the text fields.  Try running it :)

For reference, here are some command lines

python voronize.py sources/skull.png 10000 --power 1
